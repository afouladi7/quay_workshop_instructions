# Creating an Organization

## Login to Quay
From a web browser (Chrome / Firefox), Navigate to the Quay URL provided by your instructor.
Your username is `user` with your user number appended like so: `user3`. Each user's password is set to `openshift` by default. 

Once logged in, you'll be presented with the Quay dashboard. Notice a few things here true of a new user:

* Quay presents 3 Links at the top of the page (EXPLORE, REPOSITORIES, and TUTORIAL). The `TUTORIAL` link walks you through the full cycle of pushing an image into your Quay instance. This is great any time you need a quick refresher.
* You have no `Organizations` created. However, you can create repositories under your username, which acts somewhat like an Organization.
* The UI is prompting you to `Create New Organization` on the right.
